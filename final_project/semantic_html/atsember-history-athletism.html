                    San Francisco 49ers QB, Colin Kaepernick, in 2016 began kneeling during the national anthem before games in protest against police brutality. He was blackballed by the NFL, like The Syracuse 8, and has been signed, worked out, or seriously considered by NFL team since. His protest was brough back to life in the summer of 2020. On the four year anniversary of him kneeling, the NBA players boycotted playing games in the NBA Bubble citing the recent James Blake shooting.

                Daily Orange: <br>
                Players showed support on social media, SU’s men’s basketball players wore #NotAgainSU warmup shirts and some football players participated in the Barnes Center sit-in. Football players who stayed silent during the Theta Tau incident in 2018 couldn’t stay on the sidelines any longer.<br>
                
                It’s an idea that Syracuse 8 members approve of. History repeats itself, and the Syracuse 8 believe people, specifically athletes, can learn from their boycott. Can learn from the actions of Schwartzwalder, who called players racial slurs, directed medical malpractice, favored less-skilled white players on the depth chart and pitted players against each other based on the color of their skin.
