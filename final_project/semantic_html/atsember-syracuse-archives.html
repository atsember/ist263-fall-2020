                The Syracuse 8, a group of African-American football players at Syracuse University in the late 1960s, protested inequality and racism through a boycott that made national headlines.<br>

                Thirty-six years following their protest, the university formally welcomed the nine players back and recognized their impact on Syracuse's history. Nancy Cantor, the university’s chancellor, presented the memebers of The Syracuse 8 with their letterman jacket for the first time. Cantor presented them a formal apology and the Chancellor’s Medal — the university’s highest honor. Jim Brown spoke, calling it “one of the greatest nights I have been involved in." The reunion was the first step in uncovering their previously hidden history.
