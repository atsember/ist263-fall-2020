                    San Francisco 49ers QB, Colin Kaepernick, in 2016 began kneeling during the national anthem before games in protest against police brutality. He was blackballed by the NFL, like The Syracuse 8, and has been signed, worked out, or seriously considered by NFL team since.

                    <p style="background-color: chocolate;padding: 10px;">Players showed support on social media, SU’s men’s basketball players wore #NotAgainSU warmup shirts and some football players participated in the Barnes Center sit-in. Football players who stayed silent during the Theta Tau incident in 2018 couldn’t stay on the sidelines any longer.<br>
                    It’s an idea that Syracuse 8 members approve of. History repeats itself, and the Syracuse 8 believe people, specifically athletes, can learn from their boycott. Can learn from the actions of Schwartzwalder, who called players racial slurs, directed medical malpractice, favored less-skilled white players on the depth chart and pitted players against each other based on the color of their skin.

                "Michael Jordan avoided commenting on social issues during his playing career to build his brand, as an example of a lull in high-profile athlete activism (see list above).
    
                Jordan “didn’t have to fight” to play at North Carolina because the Syracuse 8 and other movements won equal rights to play" <br>

                    "Those young ball players that are on the team now, and the Black athletes at Syracuse University in general, they don't know about the Syracuse 8. And they need to know. Everybody in the university, including white people and other people of color, need to (know the history)." <br>
